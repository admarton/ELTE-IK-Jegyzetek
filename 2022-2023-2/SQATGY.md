# Software quality and testing

# Practice 1

- 3 teacher for 4 weeks, different topics
    1. Unit testing
        - Tech, ideas, feel
    2. Performance testing, Pen-testing
        - Build on the 1st
    3. Something

- Video before class than discussion
- Thursday awailable whole day
- 8th and 12th week assignment

## Unit test

- Def: Unit is a method or function
- Def: Unit test invokes another code and asserts
- Unit depends on the enviroment, product
    - Can be class, interface
    - Should be isolated
        - Nothing unexpected can happen
    - Must mock dependencies
    - Must be a simple thing
- Unit test shouldn't be complicated
- SUT: system under test
- CUT: class/code under test

### Good unit test

- Automated and maintanable
    - Sometimes cannot happen
- Easy to implement
- Should be relevant tomorrow
    - Test unique traits and problems
- Should run at the push of a button, and finnish fast
    - Depends
- Consistent results
- Fully isolated
- Fail should be usefull

## TDD, BDD

- Programming style
- Test driven and behavior driven
- Do not overtest

# Practice 2.
